# Sass TextMate Bundle

## Description

This is my personal Sass TextMate bundle. I don't intend to make this something that everyone uses. It's just what I use. Use it if you'd like, but I can't promise that it's something awesome.
 
## Installation

1. $ `cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/`
2. $ `git clone git://github.com/adamstac/sass-textmate-bundle.git sass.tmbundle`
3. $ `osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles`
