# Sass TextMate Bundle

## Description

This is my personal Sass TextMate bundle. I don't intend to make this something that everyone uses. It's just what I use. Use it if you'd like, but I can't promise that it's something awesome.
 
## Installation

<pre>
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
git clone git://github.com/adamstac/sass-textmate-bundle.git sass.tmbundle
osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'
</pre>
